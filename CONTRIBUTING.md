# How to Contribute

So you want to contribute to the project. **THIS IS GREAT NEWS!**  Seriously. We're
all pretty happy about this. All of the [instructions for contributing from 
the homebrew-cask project](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
apply, and won't be repeated here. The only changes concern getting set up to
contribute:

## Getting set up to contribute

1. Fork the repository in GitHub with the 'Fork' button
2. Add your GitHub fork as a remote for your homebrew-cask Tap

```bash
github_user='<my-github-username>'
cd $(brew --prefix)/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew-versions
git remote add $github_user https://github.com/$github_user/homebrew-versions
```
